'Albion', 1872","objectSummary":"Diary written by David Yuile who came to Victoria via New Zealand from Scotland on 21 September 1872, for his health. The diary contains daily entries which describe his departure, voyage, weeks in New Zealand, arrival in Victoria and life there until the diary abruptly ends on 9 May 1874.\n\nYuile's descriptions of life in Melbourne during the 1870s are particularly engaging, with references to rowing regattas, visits to the library, gallery and museum, domestic and cultural entertainments, sporting events such as the Melbourne Cup and cricket at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\n\nDavid Yuile was born in Glasgow, Scotland on 24 April 1849, the son of a wine merchant. Suffering from a chronic respiratory condition, his doctors recommended a long sea voyage and in September 1872, at 23 years of age, David boarded the 'City of Dunedin' headed for Dunedin in New Zealand. He arrived in Otago Bay on 30 December 1872 and remained in Dunedin, living on board the ship, until 25 January 1873 when he left for Melbourne on the 'SS Albion'. He arrived in Melbourne on 6 February 1873 where he stayed with his cousins the Hendersons at 'Myrtle Bank' on the Maribyrnong River in Footscray. He seems to have suffered bouts of ill health but spent his time planting trees and a vegetable garden at Myrtle Bank and assisting the family with business affairs. He was also involved in rowing regattas on the Maribyrnong.\n\nOn 21 November 1876 David married Martha Miller in Yarraville. By this time David was engaged in importing art and also had shares in the Australian Ruby Company. The couple had five daughters all born in Footscray, but at the time of David's death the family was living in Camberwell. David died on 12 January 1889 of consumption at the age of 39 and was buried in Kew. He left Martha and his five daughters aged from 3 to 11 years well provided for.","physicalDescription":"391 page quarto size book with lined pages and blue leather cover and black leather spine. 147 pages completed with script and illustrations with 244 pages left blank.

It is a particularly detailed guide for emigrants, including suggestions on clothing, organizing passage, shipboard life, requirements for 'bush life' and regulations relating to gold mining. The author was probably John Henry Capper, a Home Office clerk who succeeded Aaron Graham as Inspector of the Hulk Establishment at the end of 1814. He was given an annual salary of £400, with an allowance of £131 a year for the use of his home. Capper carried out the recommendations of the 1811 Committee by dividing the convict ships into compartments. In 1822 he wrote Two Reports [on Transportation]...detailing expenses and chaplains' reports on convict hulks for the House of Commons, and also authored a report on the employment of prisoners at Bermuda. However, he used a room at the Home Office while he still drew the allowance for use of his home, and during his long term of office his nephew increasingly carried out the work while also running his own grocery business on the Strand. In 1847 Capper was blamed for the slackness and corruption within the system, and a damming report on the atrocious conditions on the hulks forced Capper and his nephew to resign.

Siddeley, Egypt & Gallipoli, Vol. 2, World War I, 4 Apr 1915-11 May 1915","objectSummary":"Leather-bound second volume of a diary written by Corporal S.W. Siddeley 4 April - 11 May 1915. The diary consists of three notebooks, written between October 1914 and September 1915. It covers the first convoy, the landing of the Anzacs at Gallipoli and the campaign there. The diary contains graphic details of the landing at Gallipoli and the wounds of many, and Siddeley's work in a field hospital on the peninsula. \n\nThis volume covers the period from 4 April 1915 at Mena Camp, Cairo, through to the Anzac landing at Gallipoli, and Siddeley's service on the peninsula until 11 May 1915. A week later, on the 18 May 1915, Siddeley would suffer a concussion after being hit with shrapnel, resulting in defective eyesight and a gap in entries for many weeks; and the incident itself is not mentioned in his diary. Siddeley returned to Cairo to recover in September 1915. The latest entry in this volume is dated 4 September 11, but is only two brief lines in illegible shorthand script. It appears to be a running tab for a game, or money.\n\nThe entries in this volume point to the horrific nature of Siddeley's service in the Gallipoli campaign, the intensive losses and poor conditions described in a matter-of-fact tone, but none the less having a strong negative impact on Siddeley, as the following extract describes: 'The position of our dressing station enabled us to get a perfect view of the bombardment from the enemy and the landing of our re-enforcements. 7.30 pm. Up to the present we have not seen the sight of a stretcher bearer and had 8 seriously wounded men, shot through the abdomen, chest, head etc. I gave them Morphia [morphine] and made them as comfortable as was possible. I now had a minute to myself and when I began to think, it seemed to me a nightmare and I cried to think what had caused it' ( p.6.)\n\nThis volume also includes an incident which leads to Siddeley's temporary promotion, to Senior Medical Officer, in charge of the Brigade Medical Staff, having 120 men and 14 dressing stations in his charge. Unfortunately, this incident was the death of his superior and good friend Captain Matheson, to sniper fire, on the 11 May 1915 (p.32.)\n\nThe difficulty of the fighting conditions amongst snipers, trenches, and inhospitable terrain are highlighted in several pages of entries for the 25 April 1915 (Anzac Day). The heavy loses sustained by the A.I.F. can also be seen progressing  through his time there, with 'about 7000' Australian casualties on 27 April 1915, (p.10.), to 'barely 300 out of 4,000 left' from his 5th Battalion, on 11 May 1915 (p. 32.)\n\nOther important entries include meeting the offical jounalist Charles Bean, who Siddeley was not impressed by, on 8 May 1915, (p.23.), the Charge of the 2nd Brigade at Krithia, 8 May 1915, (p. 19), and encountering John Simpson Kirkpatrick and the 3rd field Ambulance, on 4 May 1915, (pg. 13.), where Siddeley reports he is '..glad to say he was recommended for the Victoria Cross.'  \n\nExtracts from the diary describing landings at Gallipoli are attached. Siddeley writes: 'Arrived in sight of land at 5.30 AM and could hear rifle machine gun and shrapnel fire some of which stuck to the ship at intervals. The third brigade were the first to land and were met by 1000's of Turks who were driven by the Australians a mile or more back from the beach. Our boys before landing lit cigarettes and rifles and some singing ragtime songs but several of the glory boys were killed...I think that I am quite correct in saying we all were fairly shy of shrapnel. It came down worse than a hailstorm. It was a terrible position to be in no cover and no chance of retaliating. I felt sad thinking we would all be killed before having a shot at the enemy.  When we were about ½ a mile from shore, we saw two boat loads of Australians total about 76 who were all killed. Poor fellows when we got within 15 yards from shore we had to jump, we landed in all directions, some were drowned or rather very near.' (p.5.)","physicalDescription":"Hand-written diary bound in black leather, with elastic strap to secure closed (now very stretched and ineffectual). Printed with vertial and horizontal lines.

Made by Applied Dynamics, Ann Arbor, Michigan, U. S. A. And delivered to Melbourne University in 1961.  The cost was $70,000.  It was Applied Dynamics' first exported machine.  The machine was used from 1961 to about 1986.\n\nUses of the machine included: electric power system analysis, circuit design, servo systems investigations, mechanical and aerodynamical vibration analysis, aircraft flight characteristics, chemical plant simulation, chemical reactions kinetics, nuclear reactor performance and control, structural analysis, hydraulic problems (surface and underground), biological system investigation and economic system behaviour.\n\nThe University hired one technician to service it. The two consoles were wired together, providing extra processing power.  A non- linear plug panel was later added on the top half.  Output was mainly on strip-charts, sometimes on oscilloscopes. Still in use by 1986, it was used at the University until the technician retired. MUDPAC was principally used for the solving of engineering problems. Similar computers were used for process control in oil refinery at Altona, by a car manufacturer and by a paper pulp mill. \n\nEach console contains 64 operational amplifiers (op-amps), 80 coefficient potentiometers, 16 electronic multipliers, 8 diode function generators, and 20 diode networks. The problem to be solved was wired by means of patch cords on a 1632-hole removable patchboard.\n\nThe donation also included:\n* Illuminated MUDPAC sign, which hung over the MUDPAC laboratory in the Engineering Building at Melbourne University; it is the counterpart of the CSIRAC sign which hung over the door of its digital rival in the Physics Building on the other side of the University campus.","physicalDescription":"Two separate consoles (with connection ports) accompanied by operator's manuals, patchboard and patchcords, plug connectors, spare electronic valves, operational amplifier modules, integrator modules and an illuminated sign.\n\nFor a detailed list of descriptions of items in the MUDPAC Collection, please see the Narrative entitled: 'The Melbourne University Dual Package Analogue Computer:Collection - Inscriptions & Descriptions'.","inscription":"Rear bottom of Console # 1:\nManufacturer's plate: Applied Dynamics, Inc./NAME Analog computer/PART NO. 146448/SER.

There was no certainty as to which type of computer would be the dominant type or even that one type would dominate the other.  \n\nAnalog computers were easier to program than digital computers and faster in solving certain classes of problems. However, with later advances in the ability to store and manipulate information in digital form, digital computers won the contest against analog computers.","modelScale":null,"shape":null,"dimensions":[{"configuration":"Overall Dimensions","dimensions":"2330 mm (Length), 660 mm (Width), 1300 mm (Height)","comments":null},{"configuration":"Part Dimensions","dimensions":"1150 mm (Length), 660 mm (Width), 1300 mm (Height)","comments":"Approximate dimensions of each console."},{"configuration":"Part Dimensions","dimensions":"340 mm (Length), 262 mm (Width), 20 mm (Height)","comments":"Approximate dimensions of each patch board."}],"references":null,"bibliographies":[],"modelNames":[],"brands":[],"relatedItemIds":["items/1763754","items/413439","items/399902","items/393377"],"relatedSpecimenIds":[],"relatedArticleIds":["articles/5592","articles/2511"],"relatedSpeciesIds":[],"media":[{"type":"image","alternativeText":null,"large":{"width":3000,"height":2175,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/17/484117-large.jpg","size":762087},"medium":{"width":1500,"height":1087,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/17/484117-medium.jpg","size":191054},"small":{"width":690,"height":500,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/17/484117-small.jpg","size":54145},"thumbnail":{"width":250,"height":250,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/17/484117-thumbnail.jpg","size":11344},"dateModified":"2016-11-10T03:40:00Z","caption":"Analogue Computer -

On July 13 the 9th Field Ambulance relieved the 13th Australian Field Ambulance and the ambulance moved to Rivery. The unit were relieved at Rivery by the 14th Field Ambulance on July 31 and moved to Ecole Normale to establish a Main Dressing Station (MDS).\n\nAlso included are the names of those awarded the Military Medal (see July 23) and a plan of the 'communications between huts' (see Appendix 11).\n\nPart of the collection of World War I memorabilia donated by Sergeant John Lord (#6252), although it is believed that not all of the material relates to his own war service. \n\nJohn Lord was 19 years old when he enlisted with the Australian Imperial Forces in June 1915.  Originally part of the 1st Australian Stationary Hospital, 11th Reinforcement; Lord was transferred to the 13th Australian Field Ambulance upon its formation in February 1916. He subsequently moved to the headquarters of the Assistant Director of Medical Services, 4th Division, in December 1918 where he seems to have spent the remainder of the war. Although listed as 'effective abroad,' Lord returned to Australia on 30 October 1919, and was discharged from service on 12 March 1920. He died in 1951.","physicalDescription":"Twenty-six pages, held together with a pin in the top left corner.","inscription":"Typed on the first page: '13th Field Ambulance: WAR DIARY ; Army Form C. 2118. / Instructions regarding War Diaries and Intelligence / Summaires are contained in F.S.

Originally part of the 1st Australian Stationary Hospital, 11th Reinforcement; Lord was transferred to the 13th Australian Field Ambulance upon its formation in February 1916. He subsequently moved to the headquarters of the Assistant Director of Medical Services, 4th Division, in December 1918 where he seems to have spent the remainder of the war. Although listed as ‘effective abroad,’ Lord returned to Australia on 30 October 1919, and was discharged from service on 12 March 1920. He died in 1951.","physicalDescription":"Twenty-seven pages; some of which are held together by a pin in the top left corner whilst others show signs of once being attached to the group.","inscription":"Typed on the first page: '13th Field Ambulance: WAR DIARY ; Army Form C. 2118. / Instructions regarding War Diaries and Intelligence / Summaires are contained in F.S.

The diary ends with a brief paragraph relating to the general health of the troops, along with the details of the weather and the unit’s strength.\n\nAlso included in the diary are diagrams relating to an apparatus used in the treatment of casualties suffering from shock caused by exposure and/or blood loss (See Appendix 4).\n\nPart of the collection of World War I memorabilia donated by Sergeant John Lord (#6252), although it is believed that not all of the material relates to his own war service. \n\nJohn Lord was 19 years old when he enlisted with the Australian Imperial Forces in June 1915.  Originally part of the 1st Australian Stationary Hospital, 11th Reinforcement; Lord was transferred to the 13th Australian Field Ambulance upon its formation in February 1916. He subsequently moved to the headquarters of the Assistant Director of Medical Services, 4th Division, in December 1918 where he seems to have spent the remainder of the war. Although listed as ‘effective abroad,’ Lord returned to Australia on 30 October 1919, and was discharged from service on 12 March 1920. He died in 1951.","physicalDescription":"Twenty-four unbound pages, evidence that they were once held together by a pin in the top left corner.","inscription":"Typed on the first page: '13th Field Ambulance / Aug. / 1918 Ref.

Also included in the diary are the details of the amalgamation of 1st and 4th Australian Divisions into “A” Australian Divisional Group (see March 23-24).\n\nPart of the collection of World War I memorabilia donated by Sergeant John Lord (#6252), although it is believed that not all of the material relates to his own war service.\n\nJohn Lord was 19 years old when he enlisted with the Australian Imperial Forces in June 1915.  Originally part of the 1st Australian Stationary Hospital, 11th Reinforcement; Lord was transferred to the 13th Australian Field Ambulance upon its formation in February 1916. He subsequently moved to the headquarters of the Assistant Director of Medical Services, 4th Division, in December 1918 where he seems to have spent the remainder of the war. Although listed as ‘effective abroad,’ Lord returned to Australia on 30 October 1919, and was discharged from service on 12 March 1920. He died in 1951.","physicalDescription":"Twenty-three unbound documents.","inscription":"Typed on the first page: '13th Field Ambulance: WAR DIARY ; Army Form C. 2118. / Instructions regarding War Diaries and Intelligence / Summaires are contained in F.S.

Lieutenant Colonel Frank Couper Wooster (DSO) took over as commanding officer from Lieutenant Colonel Henry Kenneth Fry (DSO) on June 12.\n\nThe diary details the setup of the 13th Australian Field Ambulance as the main evacuation point (or Advanced Dressing Station (ADS)) for the wounded en route from the ‘Forward Area’ to the Main Dressing Station (MDS). The station was visited by the Deputy Director of Medical Services (DDMS) on June 17 who ‘expressed satisfaction’ with the delousing chamber. \n\nAlso included are the names of those mentioned in dispatches (see June 11) and those awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (see June 7) along with a rough plan of the dressing station.\n\nPart of the collection of World War I memorabilia donated by Sergeant John Lord (#6252), although it is believed that not all of the material relates to his own war service. \n\nJohn Lord was 19 years old when he enlisted with the Australian Imperial Forces in June 1915.  Originally part of the 1st Australian Stationary Hospital, 11th Reinforcement; Lord was transferred to the 13th Australian Field Ambulance upon its formation in February 1916. He subsequently moved to the headquarters of the Assistant Director of Medical Services, 4th Division, in December 1918 where he seems to have spent the remainder of the war. Although listed as ‘effective abroad,’ Lord returned to Australia on 30 October 1919, and was discharged from service on 12 March 1920. He died in 1951.","physicalDescription":"Twenty-four unbound documents.","inscription":"Typed on the first page: '13th Field Ambulance: WAR DIARY ; Army Form C. 2118. / Instructions regarding War Diaries and Intelligence / Summaires are contained in F.S.

1907 in order to encourage and promote Victoria as a settlement destination for preferably British migrants. The booklet is particularly aimed at male agricultural settlers and workers, and promotes the Closer Settlement Scheme (an Act passed by the Commonwealth Government in 1904) and the Small Holdings Act (1907) which assisted residents and new migrants in the purchase and improvement of land through government loans, as well as possible reduction on steamship fares.The State Government aimed to entice people away from the overcrowded inner city and suburbs with small holdings for farming made available throughout the state.","physicalDescription":"Small cream coloured booklet, 16 pages with soft cover. Front cover features title and 'Advance Australia' coat of arms (which was in use until the Commonwealth coat of arms was introduced in 1908. This coat of arms is also presented in an inverted configuration). The back cover advertises the Closer Settlement Scheme in Victoria. The booklet includes text and images and a fold-out map of Victoria which indicates various agricultural, industrial and infrastructural 'Facts about Victoria'.","inscription":"Title: A Short Guide for Intending Emigrants to Victoria/The Garden State of Australia\nSands & McDougall Ltd., Melbourne","associations":[{"type":"Issued By","name":"J.

Lucy became a prominent member of staff at the Centre after migrating to Australia from England in 1951 and settling for a number of years in Wendouree near Ballarat in Victoria.\n\nStanley and Lucy (nee Simmons) Hathaway and their daughter Hazel survived World War II in heavily bombed Coventry, England, remaining there until 1946. They  attended the Victory in Europe celebrations there on 8 May 1945. The Hathaways relocated to Buckinghamshire (where second daughter Merle was born in 1948) and Hampshire between 1946 and 1951, finally deciding to migrate to Australia. Their application took nearly two years to be confirmed under the Assisted Passage Migration Scheme, correspondence indicating that Stanley's trade qualifications were not immediately accepted for the Commonwealth Nomination Scheme. They lived and toured England in a caravan until finally departing on the New Australia, 17 November,  1951. \n\nThe Hathaways first stayed at the Bathurst Migrant Camp in New South Wales before being relocated to a housing commission estate in Ballarat, Victoria. Within six months they had purchased a block of land in Wendouree, living in a caravan while their house was built. The family became active members of the local Ballarat community, with Lucy working for the newly established McCallum House Centre for Retarded Children at Sebastopol and continued her strong interest in the Brownies and Girl Guides associations. They later relocated to Melbourne and then retired to Buninyong.","physicalDescription":"Scrapbook, stiff, black fabric covered cover with embroidered title across the front.

This family survived one of the most severe bombings of any English city during World War II and brought with them material symbols of endurance and triumph in the Victory Day dress and Union Jack flag, symbols with almost universal resonance. The collection also includes items which tell stories about the goods migrants select in order to start new lives and the continued use of those items in Australia, the process of applying to immigrate, the adventure of the ship voyage, and the seeking of familiar interests in a new community. This particularly relates to the family's ongoing participation in the Girl Guides. The collection also explores the theme of maintaining connections and loyalties to homeland, in this case through memorabilia relating to the British monarchy and exchange projects with former local communities.","modelScale":null,"shape":null,"dimensions":[{"configuration":"Overall Dimensions -

Model made by C.E. Nordstrom in 1858.\n\nThis model depicts gold miners at Daisy Hill, near Maryborough during the Victorian gold rush. It was one of a dozen Victorian goldfields models commissioned in the late 1850s by Frederick McCoy, the director of this museum, from Swedish-born miner and artisan, Carl Nordström.\nNordström visited each location to research mining methods, and made thorough notes and sketches of the equipment, creating one of the most detailed records of early Victorian mining techniques. \nThe miners seen here are seeking alluvial gold from the hillsides flanking the creek. The gold lurks in a thin drift of 'washdirt', overlying a layer of white pipe clay, just above bedrock.\nThe numerous shafts reflect the limited 12 x 12 feet (13.4 square metres) claim size allowed to each miner.","physicalDescription":null,"inscription":null,"associations":[{"type":"Modelmaker","name":"Mr Carl E.

These dances include leaping, stepping and bowing. Usually a male and female Brolga will pair for life. Nests are built out of sticks and grasses on islands, usually in marshlands. The breeding season starts after the rainy season so varies in timing across the species' range. In the south of Australia breeding is usually between September and December. One brood is produced each year consisting usually of two eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the young for up to eleven months after they hatch. Outside of the breeding season Brolgas form large family groups, sometimes including hundreds of individuals. Brolgas largely eat plant material, digging for roots in particular, but will also eat insects and small vertebrates such as frogs. Populations of Brolgas appear to be declining, especially in the south of Australia, largely due to destruction of habitat such as the draining of wetlands.","generalDescription":"Body grey with red-orange patch on face and behind head.

Originally part of the 1st Australian Stationary Hospital, 11th Reinforcement; Lord was transferred to the 13th Australian Field Ambulance upon its formation in February 1916. He subsequently moved to the headquarters of the Assistant Director of Medical Services, 4th Division, in December 1918 where he seems to have spent the remainder of the war. Although listed as ‘effective abroad,’ Lord returned to Australia on 30 October 1919, and was discharged from service on 12 March 1920. He died in 1951.","physicalDescription":"Sixteen unbound, typed pages.","inscription":"Typed on the first page: '13th Field Ambulance: WAR DIARY ; Army Form C. 2118. / Instructions regarding War Diaries and Intelligence / Summaires are contained in F.S.

However, the page covering September 18-21 is missing from this diary, although it is present in the diary held by the Australian War Memorial.\n\nAccording to the diary, the Assistant Director of Medical Services (ADMS) gave instructions that the 4th Australian Division would be moving forward in Brigade Groups. These instructions placed the 13th Australian Field Ambulance under the command of the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 13th Australian Infantry Brigade until further notice (see September 5). \n\nSergeant John Lord is mentioned in this diary by name on September 14 as being temporarily assigned to the 3rd Echelon (Australian Section) in order to check the unit’s records. This date also records the issuing of a warning that the unit would be used in reserve for an Extensive Offensive Operation to be undertaken on September 18. \n\nPart of the collection of World War I memorabilia donated by Sergeant John Lord (#6252), although it is believed that not all of the material relates to his own war service. \n\nJohn Lord was 19 years old when he enlisted with the Australian Imperial Forces in June 1915.  Originally part of the 1st Australian Stationary Hospital, 11th Reinforcement; Lord was transferred to the 13th Australian Field Ambulance upon its formation in February 1916. He subsequently moved to the headquarters of the Assistant Director of Medical Services, 4th Division, in December 1918 where he seems to have spent the remainder of the war. Although listed as ‘effective abroad,’ Lord returned to Australia on 30 October 1919, and was discharged from service on 12 March 1920. He died in 1951.","physicalDescription":"Fourteen pages, held together by a pin in the top left corner.","inscription":"Typed on the first page: '13th Field Ambulance: WAR DIARY ; Army Form C. 2118. / Instructions regarding War Diaries and Intelligence / Summaires are contained in F.S.

It also symbolises the early stages of the development of computer networks in Australia.\n\nControl Data Corporation and CDC 3200 computers played a vital part in the setting up of two major and complex computer networks at a time where there was no such term as computer network; (the first internet-type networks were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s).  \n\nThe projects were developed independently of each other; the first was established by the Bureau of Census and Statistics to carry out an essentially business data processing operation. The second, by the CSIRO, provided a scientific computing service to its 40 or so divisions as well as engaging in computing research.\n\nThe CDC 3200 computer was designed to meet the requirements of the two projects; the design was actively promoted by (Australian) representatives of Control Data Australia.\n\nThe 3200 was an essential component of these projects but it was only part of Control Data's Australian initiative, which included providing nine CDC 3200s and the two CDC 3600s to the Bureau and CSIRO as well as other organisations. \n\nAs a result Control Data played an active role in Australia for nearly 30 years.","modelScale":null,"shape":null,"dimensions":[{"configuration":"Part Dimensions","dimensions":"720 mm (Length), 1200 mm (Width), 1000 mm (Height)","comments":"Dimensions of Keyboard."},{"configuration":"Part Dimensions","dimensions":"610 mm (Width), 915 mm (Depth), 1350 mm (Height)","comments":"Dimensions of Disk Drive."},{"configuration":"Part Dimensions","dimensions":"712 mm (Width), 880 mm (Depth), 1840 mm (Height)","comments":"Dimensions of Tape Drive."},{"configuration":"Part Dimensions","dimensions":"683 mm (Width), 1250 mm (Depth), 1910 mm (Height)","comments":"Dimensions of CPU Module."},{"configuration":"Part Dimensions","dimensions":"1080 mm (Width), 1040 mm (Depth), 1290 mm (Height)","comments":"Dimensions of Printer."}],"references":null,"bibliographies":["[Book] Rood, Sarah. 2008.

It describes her time working for the UNRRA in Germany.\n\nEsma Banner worked in displaced persons' camps in the US Zone of Germany after World War II as an employment and welfare officer for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the International Refugee Organization (IRO), from 1945 to 1951. Esma was one of 39 Australians who went to Germany to assist with post-war repatriation and re-settlement of refugees displaced by the war. More than 1000 displaced persons' camps were established by the Allied Forces. Initially created as temporary processing centres, the camps became longer term sites of accommodation, employment, education and recreation for refugees who could not, or did not want to, be repatriated to their countries of origin.","physicalDescription":"Black covered cardboard notebook.

Esma Banner served with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and later with the International Refugee Organization (IRO) at displaced persons' camps in Germany from 1946 to 1951. She was one of fewer than 40 Australians employed by UNRRA and IRO during this period. \n\nThis collection recounts the often untold story of immigration from the perspective of a migration worker and enables the documentation of many themes relating to post World War II migration including life in the displaced person camps, international refugee management, creativity and cultural maintenance, and the political complexities of post-war resettlement. Of particular note are the craft items created by refugees living in displaced persons' camps. This collection holds a variety of men's and women's work, thus providing a significant insight into life within the camps. These objects also serve as valuable examples of cultural practices and traditional skills.  \n\nThis collection and accompanying documentation presents a unique perspective of the post-World War II relief effort. Esma's diaries and letters in particular offer her personal insights and observations and demonstrate how civilians contributed to the reconstruction effort in Europe. In addition, these items add to the emerging collections of material describing women's involvements during times of conflict, as well as the larger narratives that illustrate Australia's wartime experience. After World War II hundreds of thousands of homeless, stateless or displaced people lived in camps before resettling in Western countries including Australia. This collection retains ongoing cultural relevance to these large migrant communities across Victoria and Australia. With the population of post-war displaced persons' survivors aging, the collection contributes to preserve their stories and experiences as part of a greater Australian migration narrative.","modelScale":null,"shape":null,"dimensions":[{"configuration":"Overall Dimensions - Closed","dimensions":"150 mm (Length), 85 mm (Width), 10 mm (Depth)","comments":null}],"references":null,"bibliographies":[],"modelNames":[],"brands":[],"relatedItemIds":[],"relatedSpecimenIds":[],"relatedArticleIds":["articles/12786","articles/12780","articles/13619","articles/13618"],"relatedSpeciesIds":[],"media":[{"type":"image","alternativeText":"Black covered cardboard notebook.","large":{"width":1927,"height":2993,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/30/720180-large.jpg","size":697930},"medium":{"width":966,"height":1500,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/30/720180-medium.jpg","size":158745},"small":{"width":322,"height":500,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/30/720180-small.jpg","size":17757},"thumbnail":{"width":250,"height":250,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/30/720180-thumbnail.jpg","size":5642},"dateModified":"2018-07-29T22:30:00Z","caption":"Diary - Written By Esma Banner, Germany, circa 1946","creators":["Photographer: Marita Dyson"],"sources":["Museums Victoria"],"credit":null,"rightsStatement":"Copyright Museums Victoria / CC BY","licence":{"name":"Attribution 4.0 International","shortName":"CC BY","uri":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0"}},{"type":"image","alternativeText":"Open book, one cream page dated Wednesday 6/3/46.

The shed was destroyed by the Black Saturday bushfires on 7 February 2009. \n\nThis Holden, with the registration SL165, was previously painted dark green. It was built in Australia in 1950 and was purchased by Mr Lee for $6,000 in 1998. It was the first Holden Mr Lee collected, about 10 years before the fire. He drove it about once a month and took it to a number of car shows over the ten years he owned the car. None of the six cars in his collection were insured against fire. \n\nThe Bushfires around Traralgon on Black Saturday destroyed 247 houses and killed 11 people. The fire also destroyed Mr Lee's house, which had been designed by his late wife, and all his possessions. He had decided to evacuate the property earlier in the day, after leaving 14 sprinklers running.","physicalDescription":"Steel-bodied four-door Holden sedan burnt out by fire. Surface paint coatings have been largely burned off with the some remains of pink primer extant. The exposed metal surfaces are rusted. The glass windows and windscreen have melted and the glass slumped into the interior. All interior fabric trim and upholstery have been destroyed, with only the steel frame and springs of the seats remaining. The bonnet release has warped and is jammed so the condition of the engine is unknown. Only the chrome-plated metal fittings remain relatively unscathed.","inscription":null,"associations":[{"type":"Manufacturer","name":"General Motors Holden's Ltd (GMH)","date":"1950","comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":"Koornalla","region":"Gippsland","state":"Victoria","country":"Australia"},{"type":"Date of Event","name":null,"date":"07 Feb 2009","comments":"Date the item was damaged by the Churchill Bushfire.","streetAddress":null,"locality":"Churchill","region":null,"state":"Victoria","country":"Australia"},{"type":"Past Owner","name":"Chris Lee","date":"1998-2009","comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":"Churchill","region":null,"state":"Victoria","country":"Australia"}],"keywords":["Bushfires","Motor Cars"],"significance":"Popularly known as the FX, the Holden 48-215 was the first motor car to be mass-produced in Australia and has come to represent the growing confidence of Australia in the post-1945 world. The new consumer-driven economy led to massive social changes for Australians and their urban environment as rising prosperity and car ownership allowed new housing, shopping, leisure and working opportunities. It was launched at Fishermans Bend in November 1948 by Prime Minister Ben Chifley and, together with the similar FJ, it has become one of the most readily identifiable symbols of Australia.\n\nOver the past 30 years early-model Holden cars such as this example have been increasingly valued by collectors and restorers. Chris Lee collected his Holdens because they reminded him of the cars he grew up with.

It was commissioned by the Victorian branch of the Australian Railways Union, and cost £100. \n\nThis trade union banner was carried in Eight Hour Day processions in Melbourne for many decades. Each year, thousands of unionists marched to celebrate the achievements of the union movement and express their pride in their work. In 1911 there were over 7000 members of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Railways Union. The banner shows vignettes of some of the work done by union members: signalling, shunting, plate laying, carriage building. The reverse side depicts the strength of united labour; each individual length of wood can be easily broken, but combined they are impossible to break.\n\nThe banner was restored within the Conservation Department at Museum Victoria in 2003, with financial assistance from the Rail, Tram and Bus Union. It was included on the Victorian Heritage Register on 8 December 2005.","physicalDescription":"Textile banner painted on both sides. It consists of two large sections of oil painted canvas, placed back to back and machine stitched together around the outer edge. The painted image is 3180 x 3800 mm, and with the textile border the total dimension is 3810 x 4420 mm. The media is oil on coarse weave canvas, each side with a linen interleaving layer between them. The border is the same canvas painted rich red, 220 mm wide. A green brocade border has been added to the red border. The same canvas extends to a canvas border along the top. A rope was once threaded through this with 44 metal eyelets along the top, to aid suspension of the banner during marches and rallies. \nSide A: The Power of the Unions. Central panel depicts Joseph's carpentry shop, wherein the figure of Joseph is instructing two younger figures. In the upper left corner is a depiction of carriage building; upper right transport workers; lower right surveyors at work; and lower left the station yard. There are two coats-of-arms representing Australia and Britain, the Australian one incorporating the shamrock, thistle and rose. The newly federated Australia is represented by the Southern Cross and a map of Australia, together with an emu and a kangaroo. On this side is also the motto 'Behold the power of Union'. \nSide B: Australian Railways Union: A star at the top is enclosed by wings; there is a stylised design below, possibly of wattle. In the centre is a large image of a steam engine with men in front of it. Top left image of signalman in his box; top right, railway bridge; middle left, naked worker against a tiled background; middle right, younger naked worked with two metal tools; bottom left image of a city and a railway yard; bottom right a man standing in front of a building.","inscription":"Painted side A: BEHOLD THE POWER OF UNION/ AUSTRALIAN/ RAILWAYS/ UNION\nPainted side B: AUSTRALIAN RAILWAYS UNION./ ONE INDUSTRY ONE UNION","associations":[{"type":"Artist","name":"John Hennessey","date":"circa 1911","comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":"Carlton","region":"Greater Melbourne","state":"Victoria","country":"Australia"},{"type":"Commissioned By","name":"Victorian Railways Union (VRU)","date":"circa 1911","comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":null,"region":null,"state":"Victoria","country":"Australia"},{"type":"Date Made","name":null,"date":"circa 1911","comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":null,"region":null,"state":"Victoria","country":"Australia"},{"type":"User","name":"Victorian Branch, Australian Railways Union (ARU)","date":"by 1921","comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":null,"region":null,"state":"Victoria","country":"Australia"}],"keywords":["Banners","Railways","Textiles","Trade Unions","Workers","Working Life","Workers Rights","Making History - Eight Hour Day"],"significance":null,"modelScale":null,"shape":null,"dimensions":[{"configuration":"Overall Dimensions","dimensions":"4420 mm (Width), 3810 mm (Height)","comments":null},{"configuration":null,"dimensions":"4420 mm (Width), 3810 mm (Height)","comments":"Measurement From Conservation."}],"references":"'Eight Hours' Day Banners of Victoria' - thesis by Anne Mancini, 1984, Vol. II, pp 235-236 & 302, Vol III, Figs. 72 & 73","bibliographies":[],"modelNames":[],"brands":[],"relatedItemIds":[],"relatedSpecimenIds":[],"relatedArticleIds":["articles/13462","articles/2615","articles/2613","articles/2522","articles/2614"],"relatedSpeciesIds":[],"media":[{"type":"image","alternativeText":null,"large":{"width":3000,"height":2743,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/48/327698-large.jpg","size":1763501},"medium":{"width":1500,"height":1372,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/48/327698-medium.jpg","size":356718},"small":{"width":547,"height":500,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/48/327698-small.jpg","size":56113},"thumbnail":{"width":250,"height":250,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/48/327698-thumbnail.jpg","size":14345},"dateModified":"2018-02-08T04:28:00Z","caption":"Banner for Australian Railways Union, Victorian Branch, 1912","creators":["Artist: J.

The document also describes the towns, railways, climate, laws and the administration of the area.\n\nThe exact purpose of the document is unclear, but it appears to have been issued by the Assistant Director of Medical Services, 4th Division. \n\nPart of the collection of World War I memorabilia donated by Sergeant John Lord (#6252), although it is believed that not all of the material relates to his own war service. \n\nJohn Lord was 19 years old when he enlisted with the Australian Imperial Forces in June 1915.  Originally part of the 1st Australian Stationary Hospital, 11th Reinforcement; Lord was transferred to the 13th Australian Field Ambulance upon its formation in February 1916. He subsequently moved to the headquarters of the Assistant Director of Medical Services, 4th Division, in December 1918 where he seems to have spent the remainder of the war. Although listed as ‘effective abroad,’ Lord returned to Australia on 30 October 1919, and was discharged from service on 12 March 1920. He died in 1951.","physicalDescription":"Six double-sided, typed pages.","inscription":"Typed on the first page, underlined: 'I.

This machine is the Blickensderfer Model 7 and is a development of the earlier Model 5. The designer of the typewriter was George C. Blickensderfer.\n\nThe mechanism of the Model 7 used a rotating typewheel with three rows of characters around its periphery. The typewheel was mounted in front of and above the platen. Pressing a key first rotated and shifted the type-wheel to bring the selected character in front of the printing point and then pressed the wheel down and forward against the paper and platen. Ink was applied via a roller against which the type-wheel brushed during its downstroke. The typewheel could be easily changed to accomodate different character sets.\n\nThe Model 7 was supplied with either a QWERTY 'Universal' keyboard or Blickensderfer's 'Scientific' keyboard. On the latter, the front row of keys comprised the letters DHIATENSOR which Blickensderfer claimed made up 70% of the letters used in English. This machine has a 'Scientific ' keyboard.","physicalDescription":"Metal frame mounted on wooden baseboard. Cylindrical black rubber-covered platen. Type-wheel mounted above and in front of centre of platen. Type-wheel carries three rows of characters around its periphery. Inking roller mounted on horseshoe shaped metal frame and positioned beneath and behind type-wheel.\n\nKeyboard has the DHAITENSOR 'Scientific ' layout with 28 keys for letters and other characters, and additional 'FIG' and 'CAP' keys on left-hand side. All keys are circular with white lettering on a black background. Metal spacebar extends along front and around both sides of keyboard.\n\nWooden cover with leather handle on front, attached by hook catches to sides of baseboard.","inscription":"On shield on front of type-wheel support: 'BLICKENSDERFER / NEWCASTLE-on-TYNE / MADE IN U.S.A / 7'\nOn right-hand side of type-wheel support: 'PATENTED / No. 432296  JULY 15 '90 / [List of patent numbers and dates] / No. 472692   APR 12, '92 / No. 472693   APR 12, '92 / AND OTHER PATENTS'\nSerial Number on upper rear of frame: '69671'","associations":[{"type":"Manufacturer","name":"Blickensderfer Manufacturing Company","date":"early 1900s","comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":"Stamford","region":null,"state":"Massachusetts","country":"United States of America"}],"keywords":["Office Equipment","Typewriters"],"significance":null,"modelScale":null,"shape":null,"dimensions":[{"configuration":"Overall Dimensions","dimensions":"345 mm (Width), 285 mm (Depth), 165 mm (Height)","comments":"DImensions with cover in place."},{"configuration":"Overall Dimensions","dimensions":"345 mm (Width), 285 mm (Depth), 155 mm (Height)","comments":"Overall dimensions with cover removed."}],"references":null,"bibliographies":[],"modelNames":[],"brands":[],"relatedItemIds":[],"relatedSpecimenIds":[],"relatedArticleIds":[],"relatedSpeciesIds":[],"media":[{"type":"image","alternativeText":"Early model typewriter on a wooden base.","large":{"width":3000,"height":1997,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/4/794454-large.jpg","size":611884},"medium":{"width":1500,"height":999,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/4/794454-medium.jpg","size":139669},"small":{"width":751,"height":500,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/4/794454-small.jpg","size":46278},"thumbnail":{"width":250,"height":250,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/4/794454-thumbnail.jpg","size":12038},"dateModified":"2016-11-10T03:35:00Z","caption":"Typewriter -

This site is renowned for thousands of well-preserved fossils from many species buried within its sticky tar pits. Over 160,000 <em>Smilodon</em> bones alone, representing at least 2000 animals, have been uncovered from the tar pits at La Brea. \n\nThis skull was donated to the museum in 1953 by Professor Ruben Arthur Stirton of the University of California Museum of Palaeontology on his first visit to Australia. Stirton's expeditions to Australia uncovered previously unknown relatives of kangaroos and koalas, and his great contributions to the study of palaeontology is widely recognized. \n\nThough commonly called 'sabre-toothed tigers', <em>Smilodon</em> and other sabre-toothed cats are not closely related to tigers and were not ancestors to any living cat. Named after their knife-like upper canines, they lived throughout the Americas until relatively recently, becoming extinct with the last glaciation period approximately 10,000 years ago.","isdDescriptionOfContent":null,"significance":null,"keywords":[],"collectingAreas":["Vertebrate Palaeontology"],"associations":[],"relatedItemIds":[],"relatedSpecimenIds":[],"relatedArticleIds":["articles/16061"],"relatedSpeciesIds":[],"acquisitionInformation":null,"acknowledgement":null,"museumLocation":null,"media":[{"type":"image","alternativeText":null,"large":{"width":2452,"height":3000,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/40/1069390-large.jpg","size":615279},"medium":{"width":1226,"height":1500,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/40/1069390-medium.jpg","size":137286},"small":{"width":409,"height":500,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/40/1069390-small.jpg","size":21983},"thumbnail":{"width":250,"height":250,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/40/1069390-thumbnail.jpg","size":9270},"dateModified":"2018-01-15T00:39:00Z","caption":"<em>Smilodon</em> sp., Saber-toothed Tiger, skull and jaws.

Some interiors that have been remodelled to the taste of the imagined 'owners' up to about 1860. The house comes with boards showing construction materials and methods. \n\nIt was created by Felicity Clemons. She began working on it in the 1940s when her daughter Antonia, then about three years old, was given a three-roomed dolls' house by her grandmother. Mrs Clemons was not happy with its scale or authenticity and so began a rebuilding project which continued for a period of about 40 years and has resulted in a four-storey grand house, now known as Pendle Hall.","physicalDescription":"21 room, four storey dolls house, which depicts a grand fully-furnished Georgian style country house, presented in the mid 19th century with some remodelling representing new fashions in interior design. The house contains grand family rooms, and `below stairs' areas of the house, such as the kitchen, laundry and staff quarters.","inscription":null,"associations":[{"type":"Maker","name":"Mrs Felicity A.

Ziegler & Sons, Melbourne, Victoria, circa 1883","objectSummary":"'Little Men' mechanical amusement or advertisement from Cole's Book Arcade. Depicts two 'sailors' operating revolving signs with a double-crank handle. The Little Men are dressed in sailor suits, and originally had dark-coloured caps. They may have been given their white caps bearing the names HMAS Sydney and HMAS Melbourne as a patriotic gesture during World War I - these ships were launched in 1913. \n\nThe signs are a mixture of advertising slogans for Cole's Book Arcade and wise maxims which reflect Edward William Cole's belief in human equality, education and justice. The original signs have been lost, but were probably of similar content. \n\nThe 'little men' (or 'little sailors') exhibit was made for Edward William Cole, who founded Cole's Book Arcade in 1865. It was made in Melbourne in 1883 by F. Ziegler & Sons, who also made the Gog & Magog in Melbourne's Royal Arcade, the Hawthorn Town Hall clock, the 'tower clock' at Flinders Street Station and many public clocks. They originally powered by running water, and later converted to electricity. The signs have been replaced several times, most recently in 2007, with signs that better represented what Cole might have used - including sayings from his medals and books.\n\nThe Little Men appear to have been in use continually from 1883, first at the 158 Bourke Street store of Cole's Book Arcade, then at the main Bourke Street store until 1928, and finally at 255 Swanston Street in a shop operated by Cole's daughter and son-in-law under the same name, from 1929 to 1938. They were donated to Museum Victoria in 1939.","physicalDescription":"Mechanical exhibit, consisting of a wooden box on which is perched two figures of sailors, each holding a crank handle. When the mechanism rotates, these 'little men' appear to turn the crank handle which rotates a series of hidden cogs, finally rotating a large dum below them onto which 21 double-sided signs are attached. The signs slowly flip over, allowing sufficient time for reading. \n\nThe men are dressed in black felt sailor suits (jacket and trousers) with blue-trimmed white shirt appearing from underneath and folded over to form a square panel over the shoulders. Each jacket has a rope trim at the front opening. Their caps are white with inscribed bands (see below). The faces of the men are made of a composite material and are painted pink, with blue eyes and features picked out in appropriate colours. Their hands and feet are brass.\n\nA door to the left of the signs hinges to allow access to the cog mechanism. \n\nThe 'Little Men' are housed in a glazed wooden display stand, apparently non-original.","inscription":"The white caps of the 'little men' bear the inscriptions 'HMAS SYDNEY' and 'HMAS MELBOURNE'.","associations":[{"type":"Maker","name":"F.

The letter is signed by John on behalf of George, Sarah Ann and Mary. The letter contains a description of the family's initial settlement as well as the ship voyage from Plymouth to Hobson's Bay. This includes reports of births on board ship, shipboard conditions, the Crossing the Equator celebrations, and arrival. He describes their struggles to find accommodation in Melbourne, types of housing, businesses and trades and a description of Emerald Hill where the family settled. John gained employment at Hyam's store and his early impressions of Melbourne are favourable.","physicalDescription":"Letter, 10 pages plus cover bound by loose black thread stitching at spine. The letter has been folded vertically, front cover blank but with handwritten title on back cover (when folded appears on front of document).

Medal Recommendations, 13th Australian Field Ambulance, Feb-Apr 1918","objectSummary":"A collection of medal recommendations for thirteen members of the 13th Australian Field Ambulance dated February and April 1918. \n\nAlthough dated February 27, 1918 the recommendations for a Companion of the Distinguished Order and two Meritorious Service Medals actually relate to the period between the First and Second Battles of Passchendaele (October 11-26, 1917). Major Thomas Charles Cann Evans (N/A), Private Robert John Johnsson (7963) and Sergeant Arnold Doyle Kemp (170 A) were recommended for decoration due to their work at the Advanced Dressing Station during that period. \n\nThe recommendations dated April 28, 1918 relate to the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux (24/25 April 1918). Private Harold Alfred Maurice Campbell (16261), Private John McLeay (4748), Private Arthur Gilbert Forrester (7989), Sergeant Otto Kirkby (185), Private Leonard Ernest Beale (644), Private Charles Edward Solly Mitchell (10271), Private Herbert Henry Johns (16229), Private Charles Middleton (9740), Captain Ernest Noel Brougham Docker (N/A) and Sergeant Cecil Leonard John Hayes (227) were recommended for decoration for their bravery and initiative during the battle.\n\nThose recommended for decoration in April 1918, are mentioned in the May 1918 war diary for the 13th Australian Field Ambulance as having received their decorations. The recommendations themselves are included as an appendix in the May 1918 diary held by the Australian War Memorial, but were separate in this collection.\n\nPart of the collection of World War I memorabilia donated by Sergeant John Lord (#6252), although it is believed that not all of the material relates to his own war service. \n\nJohn Lord was 19 years old when he enlisted with the Australian Imperial Forces in June 1915.  Originally part of the 1st Australian Stationary Hospital, 11th Reinforcement; Lord was transferred to the 13th Australian Field Ambulance upon its formation in February 1916. He subsequently moved to the headquarters of the Assistant Director of Medical Services, 4th Division, in December 1918 where he seems to have spent the remainder of the war. Although listed as 'effective abroad,' Lord returned to Australia on 30 October 1919, and was discharged from service on 12 March 1920. He died in 1951.","physicalDescription":"Teb unbound pages.","inscription":null,"associations":[{"type":"Date Written","name":null,"date":"Feb 1918-Apr 1918","comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":null,"region":null,"state":null,"country":"France"},{"type":"Organisation Named","name":"4th Australian Division, 13th Australian Field Ambulance","date":"Feb 1918-Apr 1918","comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":null,"region":null,"state":null,"country":"France"},{"type":"Organisation Named","name":"4th Australian Division, Assistant Director of Medical Services","date":"Feb 1918-Apr 1918","comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":null,"region":null,"state":null,"country":"France"},{"type":"Person Named","name":"Major Thomas C.

Like all echinoderms, brittle stars have a calcite skeleton called a test. Unlike in true sea stars (asteroidea), brittle stars have flexible arms and do not use tube feet in locomotion . Rather, filter-feeding brittle stars use their tube feet to move small particles of food into the jaws. Ophiuroids have five jaws surrounding their mouth, which is used for both ingestion and egestion. They use bursae for respiration and excretion. Bursae are small cilia-lined sacs through which water flows. The central disc contains the digestive glands and the madreporite, the opening of the water vascular system. \n\nBrittle stars have evolved some unusual adaptations to deal with predators. When startled, some species are able to emit bioluminescent light. Many brittle stars are able to move very quickly or even self-amputate arms as a decoy. <em>Amphiura elandiformis</em> has the ability to cast off the dorsal disc surface as a distraction to predators, including the stomach and gonads. These body parts are then able to be regenerated.\n\nReproduction in brittle stars occurs in two main ways. Some species release eggs and sperm into the water, which then go through a larval stage before settling and developing into adults. Most species however brood their young internally, and at least one species  is known to be truly viviparous. Some are also known to be hermaphroditic, and potentially self-fertilise.","generalDescription":"Unlike sea stars, brittle stars are characterised by long flexible arms that move with ball-and-socket joints. The arms are clearly distinct from the central disk. Though pentaradial symmetry is common, some ophiuroids have six or seven arms. Colour patterns vary. Most species are well-camouflaged, though tropical species tend to show vivid or contrasting colours.","briefId":"Brittle stars generally have five long, whip-like arms surrounding a central body disk.","hazards":null,"endemicity":"Native to Australia","commercial":"No","conservationStatuses":[],"web":null,"plants":[],"flightStart":null,"flightEnd":null,"depths":["Shore (0-1 m)","Shallow (1-30 m)","Deep (> 30 m)"],"waterColumnLocations":["On or near seafloor"],"relatedItemIds":[],"relatedSpecimenIds":["specimens/2223844"],"relatedArticleIds":["articles/14374"],"relatedSpeciesIds":["species/14289","species/14287"],"authors":[{"firstName":"Kalinda","lastName":"Korkman","fullName":"Kalinda Korkman","biography":"Kalinda Korkman was a Monash University intern at Museums Victoria  in 2017.","profileImage":null}],"yearWritten":"2017","media":[{"type":"image","alternativeText":null,"large":{"width":3000,"height":1993,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/12/607562-large.jpg","size":1489334},"medium":{"width":1500,"height":996,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/12/607562-medium.jpg","size":214827},"small":{"width":753,"height":500,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/12/607562-small.jpg","size":63289},"thumbnail":{"width":250,"height":250,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/12/607562-thumbnail.jpg","size":8652},"dateModified":"2018-06-07T01:27:00Z","caption":"Banded Brittle Star, <em>Ophionereis schayeri</em>.

Added strength was given by the handles being part of the structure and cut out of the reverse side. The grooves or fluting is typical of the treatment of the outer surface of shields in the central desert regions, and are classically painted with designs representing the totemic ancestors. The shields are also used in revealing these details of the ancestors to young men in ceremony and displayed during the public stages of their initiation.\n\nThis shield is known as alkwerte in the Arrernte language. It is made from tyweretye, the batswing coral or bean tree (Erythrina verspertilio).","physicalDescription":null,"inscription":null,"associations":[{"type":"Date Made","name":null,"date":"about 1950","comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":null,"region":null,"state":null,"country":null},{"type":"Maker","name":"Not Recorded","date":null,"comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":null,"region":null,"state":null,"country":null},{"type":"Clan/Language Group","name":"Arrernte","date":null,"comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":null,"region":null,"state":null,"country":null},{"type":"Place Made","name":null,"date":null,"comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":"Alice Springs","region":null,"state":"Northern Territory","country":"Australia"},{"type":"Indigenous Region","name":null,"date":null,"comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":null,"region":"Desert","state":null,"country":"Australia"}],"keywords":["Ceremony"],"significance":null,"modelScale":null,"shape":null,"dimensions":[{"configuration":"Overall Dimensions","dimensions":"718 mm (Length), 285 mm (Width), 110 mm (Height)","comments":null},{"configuration":null,"dimensions":"70 cm (Length), 28 cm (Width)","comments":"Measurement From Conservation.

Australia from 1951-1955, In the 1950s and 1960s Bernice Kopple worked as a performer on the Tivoli Circuit and as a fashion model.\n\nBernice Kopple was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1930 and migrated to Melbourne on board the ship New Australia in 1950. She was nineteen years old and travelled alone, her mother and three siblings following later. Bernice was crowned Miss New Australia during the voyage, and went on to be Miss Torquay at the Sun Beach girl contest in 1951. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Bernice worked as a model, entertainer, showgirl, snake dancer and animal handler on entertainment circuits around Australia and New Zealand. She pursued her passion for animals as a keeper at the Melbourne Zoo, lecturing on wildlife in schools and on television and developing her snake act in theatres, clubs, tent shows and drive-in cinemas.","physicalDescription":"Page 37 - 38  from album.","inscription":"Front cover, printed in gold capital letters: 'PHOTOGRAPHS'.\nInside front cover newspaper cutting: 'CONGRATULATIONS on a truly interesting/ [extensive text]...'\nFirst sheet: 'PLAZA THEATRE MELB. 1952'.\nOther sheets: Various inscriptions and newspaper printed text.","associations":[{"type":"Person Depicted","name":"Ms Bernice Kopple","date":"1951-1955","comments":null,"streetAddress":null,"locality":null,"region":null,"state":null,"country":"Australia"}],"keywords":["Assisted Immigration","Entertainment Industry","British Immigration","Theatrical Costumes","Theatrical Performances","Theatres","Scottish Immigration","Entertainers.","Fashion Models","Fashions","Swimwear"],"significance":"Statement of Historical Significance:\nBernice Kopple's story enables the exploration of a number of key social historical themes including migration, gender, popular culture and identity. Hers is a more unconventional angle on the traditional migrant story. She both perpetuates and challenges traditional female gender roles and this is being conducted at a critical time in the history of the women's movement. She is an independent woman confident in her own sexuality but her public persona and work can also be seen as contributing to female stereotypes as sexualised beings. Her story takes place in urban and rural environments, in the public and private domain.","modelScale":null,"shape":null,"dimensions":[{"configuration":"Overall Dimensions","dimensions":"275 mm (Width), 200 mm (Height)","comments":null}],"references":null,"bibliographies":[],"modelNames":[],"brands":[],"relatedItemIds":[],"relatedSpecimenIds":[],"relatedArticleIds":[],"relatedSpeciesIds":[],"media":[{"type":"image","alternativeText":"Album page, photograph, black and white, woman posing in polka dot bikini, standing.","large":{"width":3000,"height":2341,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/0/1014050-large.jpg","size":815227},"medium":{"width":1500,"height":1170,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/0/1014050-medium.jpg","size":126195},"small":{"width":641,"height":500,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/0/1014050-small.jpg","size":25848},"thumbnail":{"width":250,"height":250,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/0/1014050-thumbnail.jpg","size":6678},"dateModified":"2017-11-22T05:12:00Z","caption":"Photograph Album - Bernice Kopple, Australia, 1951-1955","creators":["Photographer: Richard Townley"],"sources":["Museums Victoria"],"credit":"Courtesy Rachel Legge","rightsStatement":"Copyright Prudence Jane Townley / All Rights Reserved","licence":{"name":"All Rights Reserved","shortName":"All Rights Reserved","uri":""}},{"type":"image","alternativeText":"Album page, photograph, black and white, woman posing in polka dot bikini, standing.

She was nineteen years old and travelled alone, her mother and three siblings following later. Bernice was crowned Miss New Australia during the voyage, and went on to be Miss Torquay at the Sun Beach girl contest in 1951. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Bernice worked as a model, entertainer, showgirl, snake dancer and animal handler on entertainment circuits around Australia and New Zealand. She pursued her passion for animals as a keeper at the Melbourne Zoo, lecturing on wildlife in schools and on television and developing her snake act in theatres, clubs, tent shows and drive-in cinemas.","physicalDescription":"Photograph album of 24 brown paper sheets bound with a blue tie on the left side in a light-blue heavyweight cardboard cover with the word 'PHOTOGRAPHS' in gold capital letters on the top left corner of the front cover.

Hers is a more unconventional angle on the traditional migrant story. She both perpetuates and challenges traditional female gender roles and this is being conducted at a critical time in the history of the women's movement. She is an independent woman confident in her own sexuality but her public persona and work can also be seen as contributing to female stereotypes as sexualised beings. Her story takes place in urban and rural environments, in the public and private domain.","modelScale":null,"shape":null,"dimensions":[{"configuration":"Overall Dimensions","dimensions":"275 mm (Width), 200 mm (Height)","comments":null}],"references":null,"bibliographies":[],"modelNames":[],"brands":[],"relatedItemIds":[],"relatedSpecimenIds":[],"relatedArticleIds":[],"relatedSpeciesIds":[],"media":[{"type":"image","alternativeText":"Album page, photograph, black and white, woman posing in polka dot bikini, standing.","large":{"width":3000,"height":2341,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/0/1014050-large.jpg","size":815227},"medium":{"width":1500,"height":1170,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/0/1014050-medium.jpg","size":126195},"small":{"width":641,"height":500,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/0/1014050-small.jpg","size":25848},"thumbnail":{"width":250,"height":250,"uri":"https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/content/media/0/1014050-thumbnail.jpg","size":6678},"dateModified":"2017-11-22T05:12:00Z","caption":"Photograph Album - Bernice Kopple, Australia, 1951-1955","creators":["Photographer: Richard Townley"],"sources":["Museums Victoria"],"credit":"Courtesy Rachel Legge","rightsStatement":"Copyright Prudence Jane Townley / All Rights Reserved","licence":{"name":"All Rights Reserved","shortName":"All Rights Reserved","uri":""}},{"type":"image","alternativeText":"Album page, photograph, black and white, woman posing in polka dot bikini, standing.

Production began in 1897 and ceased in 1910.\n\nThe typewriter incorporates a type-wheel with three rows of characters held above a cylindrical platen. A pivoted handle is moved around a curved index, marked with letters, numbers and other characters, until the desired character is reached. Movement of the handle also rotates the type-wheel to bring the selected character to the printing point. Pressing the handle down presses the type-wheel down on to the paper and platen. As the type-wheel descends it brushes against an inking roller. Three keys to the left of the index mechanism provide shift and spacing functions.","physicalDescription":"Black metal frame. Cylindrical rubber platen. Type-wheel with three rows of characters supported above platen. Inking roller mounted below type-wheel. Curved index with characters marked in black on white background. Pivoted handle linked to type-wheel moves along index to select character. Black metal cover over index mechanism.
